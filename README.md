BTBookView
==========

![Vertical](/Gifs/Book flipping.gif) 

This is a view for you to either use as-is or modify the source. The view comes loaded with the ability to:

1. Make a realistic looking book view as a subview.
2. Dropping any images as a page as easy as a one-liner.

**Background:**  
This is one of my R&D for implementing a realistic book. The idea never took off so I published here free for anyone to use and built upon.
